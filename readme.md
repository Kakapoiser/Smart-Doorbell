# Raspberri Pi Smart Doorbell
## By Dominique Denert & Gabriel Maravilla

### Motivation:
Though there are many smart doorbells on the market, when the doorbell is rung, often there isn't a clear notification of who or what is at the door. We want to create a smart doorbell that's able to distinguish people using face detection, whether that be a family member, friend, or neighbor.

### Design Goals:
Using a Raspberri Pi & its camera module, we will design a smart doorbell that can detect people and classify whether they are recognized or unknown.

### Deliverables:
* Deployed ML model on Raspberry Pi
* Lightweight face detection utilizing TensorFlow Lite
* Capture image & classify upon arrival at door
* Send notification upon arrival
